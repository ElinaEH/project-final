# Final Project
Soundseed is a full-stack application/site built with React and Node, created for songwriters to help trigger creativity and get inspired. The project includes exercises for songwriters to practice making music without external pressure. The app has an audio file uploader and an audio player. The user can easily upload new musical ideas and listen back to them. There's a storage and save feature where users can save their favorite exercises and upload audio files to their user profile.

## The problem
Technologies I’ve used in this project include: MongoDB Atlas, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The frontend features responsive design and reusable UI components built with React. I’ve used libraries such as lucide react, react icons, and wavesurfer for icons and animations. The backend implements secure user authentication, RESTful API endpoints, and cloud storage integration using Multer for audio upload handling and Cloudinary for file storage. Data is also managed through MongoDB Atlas with mongoose.

I’ve spent a lot of time debugging errors due to the wavesurfer waveform visualizer. It does work on the site now but I didn’t manage to solve one error in the browser developer tools. I think the solution is to swap this specific one for another one that doesn’t interfere with the code. I also would like to add more pages to the site to separate and re-structure some content. If I had more time I would develop the audio player and audio file uploader and have everything related to audio on a separate page. My plan from the beginning was to create more exercises which I would like to develop later on. In terms of planning, I found myself getting more and more excited the more I worked on this project, I continuously got new ideas. I had to practice limiting myself and staying focused on finishing what I already had. Overall I really enjoyed creating this fullstack project. Both coming up with the initial idea and building the frontend and backend code have been challenging but very fun!
